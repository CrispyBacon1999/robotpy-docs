  documentation <install_robotpy>`.

* If you wish to deploy code or use the Robot Simulator, see the :ref:`pyfrc installation
  documentation <install_pyfrc>`.

Using NetworkTables from Python:

* To install pynetworktables on a system that does not have RobotPy
  or pyfrc installed on it (such as a coprocessor like the Raspberry Pi), see the
  :ref:`pynetworktables installation documentation <install_pynetworktables>`.

Welcome! RobotPy is a project created by a community of FIRST mentors and
students dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics
Competition. This documentation site contains information about various projects
that RobotPy supports, including guides and API references.

.. note:: RobotPy is a community project and the tools we create are not
          officially supported by FIRST. Please see the
          `FAQ <http://robotpy.github.io/faq/>`_ for more information.

Projects
--------

The primary reason RobotPy exists is to support teams that want to write their
FRC robot code using Python, and we have several projects related to this:

* `robotpy-wpilib <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib>`_: the python implementation of WPILib for FRC
* `pyfrc <https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc>`_: provides unit testing, realtime robot simulation, and easy upload capabilities for your RobotPy code
* `roborio-packages <https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-packages>`_: Various python packages for the RoboRIO platform installable by opkg, including the python interpreter and numpy
* `robotpy-wpilib-utilities <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib-utilities>`_: Community focused extensions for WPILib

Additionally, RobotPy is home to several projects that are useful for all teams,
even if they arenâ€™t writing their robot code in python:

* `pynetworktables <https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables>`_: python bindings for NetworkTables that you can use to communcate with SmartDashboard and/or your robot.
* `pynetworktables2js <https://github.com/robotpy/pynetworktables2js>`_: Forwards NetworkTables traffic to a web page, allowing you to write custom dashboards for your robot using HTML/Javascript
* `pynetconsole <https://github.com/robotpy/pynetconsole>`_: A simple netconsole implementation in python
* `roborio-vm <https://github.com/robotpy/roborio-vm>`_: Scripts to create a QEMU virtual machine from the RoboRIO image file


There is a lot of good documentation, but there's still room for improvement.
We welcome contributions from all members of the FIRST community!
